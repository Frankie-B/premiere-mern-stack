This stack gets you up and running with dev absolutes. Webpack Dev Server for HMR integrated with an Express API server. Mongoose and MongoDB for your database, models, and session store. Elegant linting with smart defaults for consistency and all the other goodies that come from a MERN stack using the latest and greatest. 


## Getting Started
1. Run `yo ultimate-mern-stack`
2. To connect to MongoDB simply add to the `.env` file  `DB_URI=<YOUR_URI_HERE>`
